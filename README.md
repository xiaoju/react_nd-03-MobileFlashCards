# Mobile-Flashcards

This is a flash cards app for iOS and Android phones.
I built this project from scrap as part of the [React Udacity NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) [_MOOC_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course), of which I joined the first cohort starting july 2017. This was the third and last 'project' out of three, focused on [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html).

## Try the app

0. Pre-requisites:

   * git, node.js and yarn (or npm) are installed on you computer.
   * [Expo](https://expo.io) app is installed on your phone (iOS or Android), or your computer is running a phone simulator (e.g. Apple XCode, Genymotion, )

1. Clone the files to a local folder
   `git clone https://github.com/xiaoju/react_nd-03-MobileFlashCards.git`
1. Install the app:
   `yarn install` or `npm install`
1. Run the app:
   `yarn start` or `npm start`
1. Follow in-app instructions to create flash cards and quiz yourself on them.

## App architecture

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
* Local notifications are supported, as per Udacity requirement.
* Testing was done on an iPhone 6.

## Contributing

* As per release 0.1.0, this project passed Udacity review, and I'm not working on it anymore. However, feel free to contact me per email to `me@xiaoju.io` regarding any comments or suggestions.
* If you would like to work deeper on this app, I suggest you take the excellent [`React Udacity NanoDegree`](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) and create your own version of the project.
